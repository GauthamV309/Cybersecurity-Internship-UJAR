## Task 1

This task explores the **CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)** within real-world systems such as Gmail, online banking applications, and hospital EMR systems. It demonstrates how these principles are applied to protect data and maintain secure, functional operations. The report also includes interview-style questions to reinforce key cybersecurity concepts.

# Task 2: Basic Network Scan Using Nmap

In this task, I performed various Nmap scans on the target `scanme.nmap.org` to identify open ports, running services, and the operating system. The scans included basic port scanning, service version detection, OS fingerprinting, and a full port range scan. Results showed multiple open ports with services like SSH and Apache HTTP, as well as filtered ports likely protected by firewalls. The target was identified as a Linux-based system. This task helped me understand key network scanning concepts, including port states, service detection, OS fingerprinting, and ethical considerations in penetration testing.
